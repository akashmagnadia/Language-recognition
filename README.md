# Language-recognition
 Use letter frequency counts to determine what language text is in.

In this program you can modify the program such that it can be trained for different languages by changing textfiles, for example, naming a file "MacbethPortuguese.txt" and putting that text file in the same directory it will train the program to recognize Portuguese.
